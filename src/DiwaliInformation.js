            What is Diwali? What's the festival about? Diwali is an ancient
            five-day Festival of Lights, celebrated by millions of Hindus, Sikhs
            and Jains across the world. Diwali, which for some also coincides
            with harvest and new year celebrations, is a festival of new
            beginnings and the triumph of good over evil and light over
            darkness. Each religion marks different historical events and
            stories. <br />
            <br /> Hindus celebrate the return of deities Rama and Sita to
            Ayodhya after their 14-year exile. <br />
            <br />
            Sikhs particularly celebrate the release from prison of the sixth
            guru Hargobind Singh in 1619. But Sikhs celebrated the festival
            before this date. In fact, the foundation stone of the Golden Temple
            at Amritsar, the most holy place in the Sikh world, was laid on
            Diwali in 1577. <br />
            <br /> The founder of Jainism is Lord Mahavira. During Diwali, Jains
            celebrate the moment he reached a state called Moksha (nirvana, or
            eternal bliss). <br />
            <br /> When is Diwali? The festival is usually some time between
            October and November, with the date changing each year. <br />
            <br /> Traditions Many lights and oil lamps are lit on the streets
            and in houses <br />
